# Autoit-WdReplacer
Replace words in files

This software is made to help those who want to replace words in multiple files.
This is now applied to Word Files.

## The idea
The idea is to grap a list of files in the chosen folder then loop throught the list. for each file in the list there will be a loop for replacements that should be done.

## How it works
Download Autoit V3 from the official website here: https://www.autoitscript.com/site/ , setup the file and you are ready to go.

## Binaries
once you downloaded autoit you can build the script into an exe file.
