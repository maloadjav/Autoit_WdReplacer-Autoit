Replace words in files

This software is made to help those who want to replace words in multiple word files.
This is now applied to Word Files ("docx" & "doc").

The script has a GUI and support multiple word replacements in Word files.

## The idea
The idea is to bring a list of word documents in a chosen folder then loop throught the list. for each document in the list there will be a loop for replacements that should be done.

## How it works
Download Autoit V3 from the official website here: https://www.autoitscript.com/site/ , setup the file and you are ready to go.

## Binaries
once you downloaded autoit you can build the script into an exe file.
